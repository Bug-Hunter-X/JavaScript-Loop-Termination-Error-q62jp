# JavaScript Loop Termination Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript loops: incorrect or unexpected loop termination. The `bug.js` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The error involves a `break` statement within a `while` loop that terminates the loop prematurely, preventing it from completing its intended iterations.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop conditions and the impact of statements like `break` and `continue` on loop flow.
